# digit-recognizer-cnn-mnist
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built for the Kaggle Digit Recognizer competition using the MNIST dataset. Achieved 98.9% accuracy on validation. Includes data preprocessing, model training with Keras, and a clean prediction pipeline for handwritten digit classification.


# Digit Recognizer - CNN (98.9% Accuracy)

This project solves the [Kaggle Digit Recognizer competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras. The model classifies images of handwritten digits (0â€“9) from the MNIST dataset.


## ðŸ“Œ Objective

Classify grayscale 28x28 pixel images of handwritten digits into their correct numeric labels using supervised deep learning.
